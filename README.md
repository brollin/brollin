### Hi 👋

- 🚀 I'm a full stack software developer with experience in EdTech and Aerospace
- 🐴 On the side, I'm a developer for [Lichess.org](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila), the forever free, adless, and open source chess server
- 🔥 I helped build [The Canopy of Luminous Conjury](https://se.cretfi.re/canopy/), and architected an advanced app to program its visuals called [Conjurer](https://canopyconjurer.vercel.app)
- 🚥 I like to dabble with LEDs, e.g. [conjurer](https://github.com/SotSF/conjurer), [canopy-values](https://github.com/SotSF/canopy-values), [perch-leds](https://github.com/brollin/perch-leds)
- 🗺️ For fun, I made a 3D [world capitals quiz](https://github.com/brollin/nextjs) that you can check out at https://brollin.space/capitalizer
- 🎙️ Since January 2022, I code exclusively with my voice using the [Talon Voice](https://talonvoice.com/) framework and [Cursorless](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pokey.cursorless)
- 🗣 Check out [this lightning talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvx1KqyyIQ) where I demo a few Talon + Cursorless features!
