### Hi 👋

- 🚀 I'm a full stack software developer with experience in EdTech and Aerospace
- 🐴 On the side, I'm a developer for [Lichess.org](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila), the forever free, adless, and open source chess server
- 🚥 I like to dabble with LEDs, e.g. [board-game-leds](https://github.com/brollin/board-game-leds)
- 🎙️ Since 2022, I code exclusively with my voice using the [Talon Voice](https://talonvoice.com/) framework
